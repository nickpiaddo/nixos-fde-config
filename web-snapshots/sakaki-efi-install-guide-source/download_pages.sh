#
# A trivial script to download the source for a list of wiki pages
# from the Gentoo wiki, and save them in the specified files.
#
# Takes one argument, the filename of the page source file. This file
# should contain one line per file to download. Each line should have
# the page name from the wiki, followed by a space, followed by the
# filename to save to.
#
# So you could run e.g.
#   ./download_pages.sh pages.txt
# when in the repo directory, to manually update the pages. Once you
# have done this, a "git diff" will show you what has changed.
#
# The script will remove unnecessary HTML from the fetched page, such
# that if the resulting content were to be pasted back into the 'edit'
# field on the Gentoo wiki for that page, no change would be detected.
#
# The Gentoo wiki could change at any time leaving the scraping
# process used by this script invalid, so do not use it for any
# critical production purpose!
